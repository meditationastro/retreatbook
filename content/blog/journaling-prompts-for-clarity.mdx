# 25 Journaling Prompts for Clarity

Use these prompts when you feel stuck, overwhelmed, or uncertain.

## Prompts
1. What am I avoiding and why?  
2. What would I do if I trusted myself?  
3. What drains me the most each week?  

## Use with retreats
If you want deeper clarity, retreats provide the time and environment for honest reflection.
